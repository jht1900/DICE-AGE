These three files are examples of games made with Director 8. They are all from "Advanced Lingo for Games," a book by Gary Rosenzweig, published by Hayden Books. In addition to these three games, there are 20 other open-source games on the CD-ROM for the book, along with detailed information about each game in the text. For more information, look for the book in your local bookstore, or check out http://clevermedia.com/resources/bookstore/book4.html.In each of these games you will find several behaviors. Many of these behaviors have customizable parameters that can be changed using the Behavior Inspector. Doing so will change things about each game, such as the speed of the elements. Other changes can be made to the games by tinkering with the code.If you are interested in learning more about these games, purchase the book. Each game has its own chapter describing how the game was built and pointing out how pieces of the code work.Also, check out http://clevermedia.com/resources/ for more resources for Director developers. There you will find information about this book and the complete guide to Director 8, "Using Director 8" by Gary Rosenzweig, published by QUE.
