<!-- TextStart -->
<p>SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 15, 2000--High-tech
industry leaders are coming together today to announce their support
for the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network -- an innovative and
collaborative effort to bridge the digital divide.
<p>The announcement was made here at the East Side San Jose Boys &amp;
Girls Club, where the first Intel Computer Clubhouse of a planned
global network of 100 was opened. A network of ``invention workshops''
that will impact the lives of thousands of young people in underserved
communities, The Intel Computer Clubhouse Network provides young
people with access to technology and helps develop technology skills
that open up options and opportunities, encourage self-confidence, and
foster creativity.
<p>In addition to Intel Corporation's $20 million investment over the
next five years, Adobe Systems Inc., Macromedia, Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard, and Autodesk, Inc., announced their commitment of a
total of more than $10 million in equipment, software, hardware and
services to the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network.
<p>``The high-tech industry's commitment to the Intel Computer
Clubhouse Network shows the positive impact we can have when we join
together to address community needs,'' said Craig R. Barrett, Intel
president and chief executive officer. ``The Clubhouse operates on a
`learning-by-doing' philosophy that provides youth not only access to
technology, but also meaningful skill-building opportunities to help
them succeed.''
<p>There will be a steady stream of Intel Computer Clubhouses opening
through the end of this year. In addition to San Jose, sites include
East Palo Alto, Calif.; Sacramento, Calif.; Washington, D.C.;
Chandler, Ariz.; Santa Fe, N.M.; Albuquerque, N.M.; Beaverton, Ore.;
Portland, Ore.; Tacoma, Wash.; and Qiryat-Gat, Israel.
<p>A Collaborative High-Tech Initiative
<p>Intel will provide financial, technical, career and volunteer
mentor support to establish the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network
globally. In addition to equipment donations, a team of Intel
professionals will install the technology and networking capability to
link Clubhouse youth around the world and provide technical training
to Clubhouse staff and members. First-year cost for each Clubhouse is
approximately $200,000. Additional support will come from:
<ul><li>Adobe Systems Incorporated is the largest software donor to
the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network, providing product valued
at more than $5.9 million to Clubhouses worldwide.<li>Macromedia, Inc. has donated $2.8 million worth of software,
including Macromedia&reg; Director&reg; Shockwave&reg; Studio and
Macromedia Dreamweaver&reg; Fireworks&reg; Studio software
products.<li>Hewlett-Packard Company is contributing $1 million this year
to support the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network for PCs,
printers, scanners and digital cameras.<li>Autodesk Inc. has contributed $500,000 worth of the
award-winning design programs, 3-D Studio Max and Character
Studio, used for 3-D modeling and character animation.
</ul>
<p>In addition to these high-tech leaders, other organizations
lending support to the Clubhouse initiative include:
<ul><li>The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (ATAS) has agreed
to provide mentors from its ranks of entertainment executives
and artists, and to support internships in the
telecommunications industry.<li>The LEGO&reg; Company will supply MINDSTORMS(TM) kits to all 100
Clubhouses, enabling youth to build robots and other
interactive constructions.<li>Haworth, Inc., a partial sponsor, will provide discounted
furnishings to the Clubhouses.
</ul>
<p>Going Beyond Access to Building Skills
<p>The Intel Computer Clubhouse Network learning model is a departure
from traditional after-school programs that concentrate on homework
and tutorials. Launched in February 2000 by Intel -- in cooperation
with Boston's Museum of Science, the museum's award-winning Computer
Clubhouse, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media
Lab -- the Network is both a physical location and a proven,
successful learning model. The Intel Computer Clubhouse provides an
environment where youth are encouraged to ``learn by doing'' and develop
meaningful skills that will open up new possibilities for their
futures. The Clubhouse aims to go beyond mere access to technology by
providing a safe, creative environment where young people from
underserved communities work closely with adult mentors to explore
their own ideas, develop skills, and build confidence through the use
of technology.
<p>At this ``invention workshop,'' Clubhouse youth, aged 8 to 18,
express themselves through projects based on their own interests to
become designers of computer-based products, not just consumers. They
create computer-generated art, music and video; develop scientific
simulations; design their own animations; build kinetic sculptures and
robots; develop their own web pages; and program their own computer
games.
<p>Intel Innovation in Education
<p>The Intel Computer Clubhouse Network is a key component of the
Intel Innovation in Education initiative, a global, multimillion
dollar effort to help realize the possibilities of science and
technology in education. Intel develops and supports education
programs that help meet the needs of students and communities
worldwide through improving science, math, engineering and technology
education; improving education through the effective use of technology
in classrooms; and broadening access to technology and technical
careers. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.intel.com/education">www.intel.com/education</a>.
<p>Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading
manufacturer of computer, networking and communications products.
