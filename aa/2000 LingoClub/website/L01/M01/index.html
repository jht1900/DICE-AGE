It's easy to   get lost in all the windows. Use the following window layout to make things   more manageable:</p><p><img src="WindowLayout.jpg" width="512" height="375"></p><p>The layout assumes you have at least a 1024x768 size display.</p><p>The <b>Stage Window</b> is where your movie (animation, game or what ever)   is displayed Set the stage size to 512x342 using the Menu Modify-&gt;Movie-&gt;Properties   or Cmd-Shift-D, which displays Movie settings pane in the <b>Property Inspector   Window</b>.</p><p>The <b>Control Panel</b> is used to start and stop the movie. It displays the   current frame and frame rate (how fast your movie plays). The current frame   is allow marked in the Score window the Playback head, a red vertical line.</p><p>The <b>Cast Window</b> holds all the element make up your movie - art work,   sounds, scripts and other stuff. The &quot;Cast View Style&quot; button switches   between a list view and an icon view. Use the icon view for now.</p><p>The <b>Property Inspector</b> Window displays information about the last thing   you clicked with the mouse. Click in the Cast Windows, and then on the Stage   to see the different settings in the <b>Property Inspector</b>.</p><p>The <b>Score Window</b> shows sprites, the animated elements in your movie.   Time is represented as a grid of frames. Time goes forward as you go from left   to right.</p><p>This layout helps you see how elements interact.</p><p><br>  When you create a piece of art work in Director's <b>Paint Window</b>, for example,   an icon for it will appear in the <b>Cast Window</b>. The elements in the <b>Cast   Window</b> are called <b>Cast Members. </b>Which makes sense since they perform   on the <b>Stage Window.</b> When you drag a <b>Cast Member</b> from onto the   Stage Window it will appear on the <b>Stage</b> and in the <b>Score Window.   </b>The<b> Cast Member </b>is represented in the<b> Score </b>a long bar called   a<b> </b> <b> Sprite</b>. </p><p>Here's how a single <b>Cast Member</b> appear as three slightly different <b>Sprites</b>   in the <b>Score</b>.</p><p><img src="PaintWindow.jpg" width="514" height="384"></p><p>The three horizontal bars in the <b>Score</b> are called <b>Sprites. </b>All   three sprites are based on the <b>Cast Member</b> in slot 1 in the <b>Cast Window</b>.<br>  The <b>Property Inspector's Sprite</b> pane is used to adjust the Ink to &quot;Matte&quot;   and Background Color (the color chip next to the Paint Bucket icon) of the three   <b>Sprites</b>.</p><p>The length of the <b>Sprite</b> tell you how long the it will appear on the   stage. In this example each sprite appears on frame 1 and stays on Stage until   frame 28. The Sprite shows the placement of the <b>Cast Member</b> in time.   You can click and drag <b>Sprites</b> in the <b>Score</b> to control when it   will appear. You can also Copy and Paste <b>Sprites</b> in the <b>Score</b>.</p><p>Clicking and dragging on a <b>Sprite</b> on the <b>Stage</b> will change <i><b>where</b></i>   it appears on the Stage. Clicking and Dragging a Sprite in the <b>Score</b>   will change <i><b>when</b></i> it appears. </p><h2>Challenge 1:</h2><p>Create a single Cast member using the Paint Window. Place the Cast member on   the stage three times. Use the Property Inspector to give each sprite a different   appearance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>!!@ Other setup:</p><p>Standard View</p><p>Script Window as Behavior editor</p><p>Show cast name and number</p><p>&copy;2000 John Henry Thompson.</p><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
