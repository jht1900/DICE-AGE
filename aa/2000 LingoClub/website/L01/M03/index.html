In this mission we'll use scripts   to stop an animation and give the player a choice to continue it. To do this   we'll need to use two type of scripts: Frame Scripts and Sprite Scripts.</p><p>!!@ Talk a litte more about why this is useful</p><h3>Frame Scripts.</h3><p>Here is a Frame scripts to hold the Playback Head on the current frame:</p><p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">on exitFrame<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go the frame<br>  end </font></p><p>The first statement &quot;on exitFrame&quot; indicates that the following line   should be executed when the Playback Head exits the frame. Later well see other   &quot;on&quot; statements that are trigger by other events. The statement &quot;go   the frame&quot; keeps the Playback Head on the current frame.</p><h3>Creating a Frame Script.</h3><ul>  <li>Create an simple animation of an object moving from left to right on the     Stage.</li>  <li>Click in a Frame Script Cell - just above the frame numbers in the Score     Window:</li></ul><p><img src="./FrameScriptChannel.jpg" width="320" height="165"></p><ul>  <li>Begin typing the statement &quot;go the frame&quot;, without the quotes.     A Behavior Script Window should popup:</li></ul><p><img src="./FrameScript1.jpg" width="276" height="172"></p><ul>  <li>Note that the Behavior Script also appears in the Cast window as a new Cast     member. Close the window and play the movie. The Playback head should stop     on the frame with the script.</li></ul><p>Once a script is created you can use it again by dragging in from the Cast.   In this case you can have the Playback head hold on the another frame by dragging   the script to another Frame Script Cell. Give it a try.</p><h3>Sprite Scripts</h3><p>Once the movie stops, we want to provide a button to continue the animation.   Any Sprite can be made into a button by attaching a Script to it. Attaching   the following Script will make the Playback Head continue after it is stopped   with a &quot;go the frame&quot; Frame Script:</p><p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">on mouseUp<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go the frame+1<br>  end</font></p><p>The &quot;on mouseUp&quot; statement means execute the following statement   when the mouse is release on the Sprite. The statement &quot;go the frame+1&quot;,   uses the same go command as before, but now the target frame is the calculation   of the current frame number (the frame) plus 1.</p><p>Here's how to create this Sprite Script:</p><ul>  <li>Click on the Sprite in your movie.</li>  <li>Select the Behavior pane in the Property Inspector. It is the tab that looks     like a cog next to the &quot;Sprite&quot; pane.</li>  <li>From the &quot;+&quot; button drop down menu select &quot;New Behavior&quot;   </li></ul><p><img src="./NewBahavior.jpg" width="219" height="258"></p><ul>  <li>A New Behavior Dialog Box should appear. Enter the name for this script.     The name is simply a comment to you. It does not change the meaning of the     Script.</li></ul><p><img src="./NewBehaviorDialog.jpg" width="349" height="114"> </p><ul>  <li>You 'll get an empty Script Window. Enter the &quot;on mouseUp...&quot;     script:</li></ul><p><img src="./GoTheFrame1.jpg" width="452" height="176"> </p><ul>  <li>Close the Script Window. The Script should now be created and attached to     the Sprite. You'll see the Behavior Script listed in the Behavior Pane of     the Property Inspector:</li></ul><p><img src="./GoTheFrameProp.jpg" width="216" height="254"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Watch Out!</h3><p>!!@ Give pointers on what can go wrong and what to do about it</p><p>Watch out for miss spellings, for example: &quot;on mouse Up&quot; is not right   (notice the space).</p><p>Watch out for attaching Frame Script to Sprite.</p><p>Use Remove Behavior to clean up.</p><p>Worst case delete all in the Score and rebuild.</p><h3>Know the Lingo.</h3><p>!!@ review terminology</p><p>Here is the Frame Script again.</p><p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">on exitFrame<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go the frame<br>  end </font></p><p>Here is the Sprite Script again.</p><p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">on mouseUp<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go the frame+1<br>  end</font></p><p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Handlers.
