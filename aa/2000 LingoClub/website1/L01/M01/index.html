It's easy to   get lost in all the windows in Director, to avoid alot of clutter use the following   window layout:</p><p><img src="WindowLayout.jpg" width="512" height="375"></p><p>The layout assumes you have at least a 1024x768 size display.</p><p>The <b>Stage Window</b> is where your movie (animation, game or what ever)   is dislayed. Set the stage size to 512x342 using the Menu Modify-&gt;Movie-&gt;Properties   or Cmd-Shift-D, which displays Movie settings pane in the <b>Property Inspector   Window</b>.</p><p>The <b>Cast Window</b> holds all the element make up your movie - art work,   sounds, scripts and other stuff. The &quot;Cast View Style&quot; button switches   between a list view and an icon view. Use the icon view for now.</p><p>The <b>Property Inspector</b> Window displays information about the current   selection.</p><p>The <b>Score Window</b> shows sprites, the animated elements in your movie.   Time is represented as a grid of frames. Time goes forward as you go from left   to right.</p><p>This layout helps you see how elements interact.<br>  When you create a piece of art work in Director's <b>Paint Window</b>, for example,   an icon for it will appear in the <b>Cast Window</b>. The elements in the <b>Cast   Window</b> are called <b>Cast Members. </b>which makes sense since they perform   on the <b>Stage Window.</b> When you drag a <b>Cast Member</b> from onto the   Stage Window it will appear on the <b>Stage</b> and in the <b>Score Window.   </b>The<b> Cast Member </b>is represented in the<b> Score </b>a long bar called   a<b> </b> <b> Sprite</b>. </p><p>Here's how a single <b>Cast Member</b> appear as three slightly different <b>Sprites</b>   in the <b>Score</b>.</p><p><img src="PaintWindow.jpg" width="514" height="384"></p><p>The three horizontal bars in the <b>Score</b> are called <b>Sprites. </b>All   three sprites are based on the <b>Cast Member</b> in slot 1 in the <b>Cast Window</b>.<br>  The <b>Property Inspector's Sprite</b> pane is used to adjust the Ink to &quot;Matte&quot;   and Background Color (the color chip next to the Paint Bucket) of the three   <b>Sprites</b>.</p><p>The length of the <b>Sprite</b> tell you how long the it will appear on the   stage. In this example each sprite appears on frame 1 and stays on Stage until   frame 28. The Sprite shows the placement of the <b>Cast Member</b> in time.   You can click and drag <b>Sprites</b> in the <b>Score</b> to control when it   will appear. You can also Copy and Paste <b>Sprites</b> in the <b>Score</b>.</p><p>Clicking and dragging on a <b>Sprite</b> on the <b>Stage</b> will change <i><b>where</b></i>   it appears on the Stage. Clicking and Dragging a Sprite in the <b>Score</b>   will change <i><b>when</b></i> it appears. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
